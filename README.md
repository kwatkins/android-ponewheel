This application is not officially endorsed by the [OneWheel] company.

Looking for extended and hidden stats from your fancy new OneWheel? And what about logging of these stats to figure out where exactly did things go wrong and cause you to eat asphalt? 

This app does log all these stats and also shows footpads that are activated, lifetime miles on your OneWheel, trip top speed, and more. Additionally this app includes power settings like setting the OneWheel LED front/back lights and brightness, as well as triggering vibrations based on battery levels. 

This is still a work in progress and on the rough side - be careful out there, and use at your own risk. For questions, any and all feedback, please send to [kwatkins@gmail.com](mailto:kwatkins@gmail.com).

Available on [Google Play].


Thanks to my lady Linda Luu for giving it the usability and graphics it desperately needed. And thanks to [christorrella@gmail.com](mailto:christorrella@gmail.com) for pushing to open source it.
